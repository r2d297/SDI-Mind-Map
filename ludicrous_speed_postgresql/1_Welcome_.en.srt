00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Welcome to Ludicrous Speed Postgres. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to educate you on Postgres performance and I'm glad that you decided to invest in yourself.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to be presenting the framework, the perspective, and the knowledge that I use in my own projects and for the clients that I work with.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
However, as you're going through the course, I encourage you to modify or change up how I do things if it works better for you.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
My most important metric is you learning and applying the information presented in this course to make your Postgres databases as fast as possible.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Basically, I want this course to make you a Postgres Performance Master, a wizard if you will, but it's going to require some work on your part, so please be sure to dedicate time to the lessons each week.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:02,000
However, if you happen to fall behind, don't worry. Everything is recorded, even the live Q&As will be recorded, and you have access to the course for the next two years.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Lastly, I do want you to keep in mind that this is an entirely new course, and even though I've spent a fair amount of time on it, I'm sure you're going to find some rough spots or some things that are confusing to you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So, I really want to hear your feedback so that I can make adjustments and make the course the best it can be, because I want to give every student the biggest wins possible.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And with that, let's go over each of the modules of the course.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So, the first module is Performance Fundamentals.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, when you're thinking about performance, it's important to start with the right mindset, and here we're going to be talking about the conceptual framework and the thought processes that I use when I go out consulting on Postgres.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, I think these really are fundamentals that will help you throughout the rest of the course.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The next module is Exploring B-Tree Indexes.

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're going to learn different techniques to get the most out of B-Tree indexes.

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So, we cover things like multi-column indexes, partial indexes, expression indexes, as well as things like index-only scans and covering indexes.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So, all the different ways you can use the standard index type in order to get the most performance.

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The third module is Optimizing Indexes.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So, here we're going to be covering things like vacuum, analyze, and the importance of statistics.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We also cover things like the importance of re-indexing, as well as removing unused indexes.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
For the fourth module, we're going to be covering optimized data and index types, because the right data can lead to better performance.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So, we talk about the use of UUIDs, Booleans, arrays, and range types.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We also go into other index types other than B-Tree indexes, such as GIN, GIST, BRIN, and Hash.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The fifth module covers Text and JSONB Search.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So, large amounts of text and JSONB data can be challenging to store in the database, and we explore different ways that you can search through that data,

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,000
talking about full text search and fuzzy search, as well as different ways to target JSONB and which index types to use.

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The sixth module, we're going to be covering advanced querying techniques.

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:39,000
These are things that you can use on occasion to get more performance, things like lateral joins, distinct on, CTEs, and even things like keyset pagination.

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
For module seven, we're going to be covering handling excessive data changes.

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So, excessive data changing can really tank your performance.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So, we discuss how to handle large insert workloads or large update workloads, or even just how to do bulk loading.

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And then the eighth module, we cover partitioning, aggregates, and beyond.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So, basically, eventually you're going to need to use different types of data handling solutions to handle your data, such as partitioning,

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
or maybe you need to use materialized views, or do summary tables or aggregate tables to give yourself the best performance out of Postgres.

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So, that's basically the content in all eight modules.

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So, I wanted to give you three pieces of guidance as you go through the course.

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So, number one is complete each module and lesson.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Sometimes one lesson builds upon another, and particularly the performance fundamentals in the first module are going to be discussed at different points in every other module.

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Number two is participate in the community.

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So, the community is where different announcements are going to be made about the course.

40
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:02,000
For example, if maybe a time change needs to happen, it's also a place where you can give feedback about the course, or it's a place to ask for help or even converse with your fellow students.

41
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And the third is to participate in the Q&As.

42
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So, even if you don't have a particular question, even if you attend them, you can hear what other students are asking, and it's a great way to increase your knowledge in general,

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
because I actually don't know what questions may come up during the Q&As.

44
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They may bring up questions that are outside of the course or something that they're working on themselves.

45
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But those are my three areas of guidance I think you should focus on for the course.

46
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, now for some logistics.

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Basically, these eight modules will be delivered over eight weeks.

48
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Now, in terms of access to the community, a link will appear in this welcome lesson once it's ready.

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And if you have any logistical problems working with the course or going through the lessons or things of that nature, you can contact support@rubytreesoftware.com.

50
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And as I said, I definitely want this course to make you a Postgres Performance Master.

51
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I know you may fall behind periodically, but I encourage you to try to get yourself caught up if you can, and reach out for assistance if you're stuck on something.
