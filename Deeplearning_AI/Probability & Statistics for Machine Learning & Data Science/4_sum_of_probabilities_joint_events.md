00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.410
Welcome back. In our
previous lessons,

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.550
we talked about the sum of

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.055
probabilities for
disjoint events.

4
00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:10.995
But what happens when the
events are not disjoint?

5
00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:12.765
Well, a problem may happen.

6
00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:13.950
Let me give you an example.

7
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.400
Let's say that the probability
of rain is 80% and

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.245
the probability of
being windy is 70%.

9
00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:24.855
What's the probability
of rain or wind?

10
00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.180
Well, if you add them,
you get 80% plus

11
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.625
70% and that's 150%.

12
00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:31.005
That is way too much,

13
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.280
and it's completely wrong

14
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.445
because the events
are not disjoint.

15
00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:37.980
You could have rain and
wind at the same time,

16
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.400
and that's the key.

17
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.815
In real-world situations,
events are not often disjoint

18
00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:44.000
and we need to account for

19
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.490
this possibility of
overlapping outcomes.

20
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.950
The sum rule for joint
events allows us to do

21
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.525
this and to calculate the
probability of combined events.

22
00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:54.470
Get ready to dive deeper
into the world of

23
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.000
probability and learn how to

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.435
use the sum rule
for joint events.

25
00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:00.920
We're back to the school
from the previous example,

26
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.270
except in this one, kids can

27
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.690
play as many sports
as they want.

28
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.880
They don't have that restriction

29
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.605
that they can only
play one sport.

30
00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:08.690
The options are still soccer

31
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.175
and basketball. Here's
a question for you.

32
00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:13.850
If the probability of a
kid playing soccer is 0.6

33
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.865
and the probability of a kid
playing basketball is 0.5,

34
00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:18.620
what's the probability
that a kid

35
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.930
plays soccer or basketball?

36
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.700
Again, if you need a hint,

37
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.380
imagine that there's
only 10 kids in

38
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.350
the school and do
the math like that.

39
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.800
Let's see, this one's a
bit more complicated.

40
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.850
Here are the 10 kids and
60% that play soccer are,

41
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.215
for example, this six,

42
00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:36.660
and the 50% that
play basketball are,

43
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.980
for example, this five.

44
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.515
But this could change.

45
00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:40.850
There could be an overlap.

46
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.715
When that happens, then we don't

47
00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:48.230
really know how many children
playing multiple sports.

48
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.480
Let's look at it
in a Venn diagram.

49
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.175
Here's 100% of the kids,

50
00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:54.785
and here's the 60%
that play soccer,

51
00:01:54.785 --> 00:01:58.430
and here is the 50%
that plays basketball.

52
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.110
Originally we had this equation,

53
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.225
P(S union B) is P(S) + P(B).
But that doesn't work.

54
00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:06.470
As a matter of fact, even
if you try to add them,

55
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.880
you would get 110%,

56
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.520
which is more than the number
of kids in the school,

57
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.200
so there's something
we're over-counting.

58
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.660
What we're over-counting
is this intersection here.

59
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.010
That is this one kid
who plays both sports.

60
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.300
That is P of S intersection B,

61
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.950
the intersection of two events

62
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.560
is when both of them
happen at the same time,

63
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.275
so the kids who play
soccer and basketball.

64
00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:29.090
It could be one, but it

65
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.790
could also be a
different number,

66
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.810
could be three, for example.

67
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.585
What we need is we need
the information of

68
00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:37.930
how many kids play

69
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.590
both soccer and basketball

70
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.320
in order to solve this problem.

71
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.515
Here's the information.

72
00:02:43.515 --> 00:02:48.305
Same school and the kids can
play soccer or basketball.

73
00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:50.270
Now let's actually
do it with numbers.

74
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.990
Six kids play soccer,

75
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.800
five kids play basketball,

76
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.535
and three kids play both sports.

77
00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:01.190
The question for you
is how many kids

78
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.200
play soccer or basketball?

79
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.440
It can be soccer or
basketball or both.

80
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.165
Well, let's break
the problem down.

81
00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:09.770
Six of them play soccer,

82
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.570
five of them played basketball,

83
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.910
and that's all the
kids over here.

84
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.690
Now we know that
three play both.

85
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.520
That's eight because
there's two over here,

86
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.740
don't play soccer or basketball.

87
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.995
In the Venn diagram,
it's like this.

88
00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:26.975
Here's 100% of the kids.

89
00:03:26.975 --> 00:03:28.685
Here's the ones
that play soccer,

90
00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:31.370
here's the ones that
played basketball

91
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.930
and the ones that play

92
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.330
both are in this
extra section here.

93
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.370
That's the ones that play
soccer and basketball.

94
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.995
We have the following formula.

95
00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:41.990
The size of the
set S of kids that

96
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.660
play soccer union
the set B of kids

97
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.520
that play basketball
is the size of

98
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.480
the set S. That is
the six over here,

99
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.745
plus the size of the set B,

100
00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:54.340
which is this five over here.

101
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.655
But we've over-counted.

102
00:03:55.655 --> 00:03:57.350
Notice that those
three kids that play

103
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.110
both sports were counted twice,

104
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.490
so we need to subtract them.

105
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.425
We'd subtract these
three over here.

106
00:04:03.425 --> 00:04:06.020
Now we have a count of

107
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.555
how many kids play soccer
or basketball as 6+5-3,

108
00:04:10.555 --> 00:04:12.390
and that's going to be eight.

109
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.715
This is also known as the
inclusion-exclusion principle.

110
00:04:15.715 --> 00:04:17.720
Now we can represent
the same thing

111
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.150
except with probabilities.

112
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.830
Again, the same problem
with soccer and basketball.

113
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.390
But now we're not
going to say that

114
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.110
six kids play out of 10.

115
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.980
We're going to say that the
probability of a kid playing

116
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.090
soccer is 0.6 and

117
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.295
the probability of a kid
playing basketball is 0.5,

118
00:04:31.295 --> 00:04:35.205
and the probability that
a kid plays both is 0.3.

119
00:04:35.205 --> 00:04:38.060
Given this information, what is

120
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.495
the probability that a child
play soccer or basketball?

121
00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:44.490
Just like before, we
can do a Venn diagram.

122
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.280
We can look at the
ones that play

123
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.575
soccer and the ones
that play basketball,

124
00:04:48.575 --> 00:04:51.200
and the probabilities follow

125
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.870
the same inclusion-exclusion
rule as before.

126
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.085
We have P(S union
B) is P(S) + P(B).

127
00:04:58.085 --> 00:05:00.515
But we're over-counting
the intersections,

128
00:05:00.515 --> 00:05:03.770
over-counting P of
S intersection B.

129
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.655
We have to subtract it because
we're counting it twice.

130
00:05:06.655 --> 00:05:09.855
That's 0.6 + 0.5 -0.3,

131
00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:15.170
which is 0.8. so let's turn into our
two examples visually,

132
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.700
in the problem in the left,

133
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.635
the kid can only play one sport,

134
00:05:18.635 --> 00:05:20.525
so the events are disjoint,

135
00:05:20.525 --> 00:05:23.360
is much easier to calculate
probabilities here

136
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.150
because all we have
to do is add them.

137
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.000
They don't overlap.

138
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.810
In the case over
here, they overlap.

139
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.825
In order to calculate
the probability

140
00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:34.775
of the union of the events,

141
00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:38.465
we need to take the
intersection into account.

142
00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:40.325
The case on the left is called

143
00:05:40.325 --> 00:05:42.710
disjoint events or
mutually exclusive,

144
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.075
and for this case,

145
00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:45.635
the probability of the union

146
00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:47.375
is the sum of the probabilities.

147
00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:49.160
For the case in the right,

148
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.185
this one is called joint

149
00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:54.945
and also called
non-mutually exclusive.

150
00:05:54.945 --> 00:05:58.535
For this, we have to follow
the formula P(S union B)

151
00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:02.240
is P(S) + P(B) - P
of S intersection B.

152
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.160
Notice that the case in,

153
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.140
the left follows from the
case in the right because

154
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.300
S intersection B is
just the empty set,

155
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.590
so the probability is zero.

156
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.880
But to be more precise,

157
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.940
we can look at both cases.

158
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.095
Now let's see this
for a pair of dice.

159
00:06:16.095 --> 00:06:18.995
Question is what is the
probability of obtaining a sum

160
00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:22.375
of seven or a difference of one?

161
00:06:22.375 --> 00:06:24.390
Well, let's take a look.

162
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.745
The sum of seven is

163
00:06:25.745 --> 00:06:28.130
all these cases over here,
as you've already seen,

164
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.630
and the difference of one is
all these cases over here.

165
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.730
Now before we used
to just add them,

166
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.830
but this time is a
little more difficult.

167
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.270
We're going to call
the one on the left A

168
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.085
and one on the right B.

169
00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:44.795
We're going to say that A or
B is these ones over here,

170
00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:47.880
except that we have
double counted these two.

171
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.760
The sum equals seven
and the difference is

172
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.730
one are double counted.

173
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.650
In order to not
double-count them,

174
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.220
we have to subtract
that probability.

175
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.180
The probability of sum equals
seven or difference is

176
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.200
one is this 6/36

177
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.240
for the sum is 7
plus this 10/36,

178
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.570
where the difference is one,

179
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.920
minus what we're over-counting

180
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.410
because for 4,3 and
3,4 are counted twice.

181
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.735
We have to subtract 2/36.

182
00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:26.590
We get 6/36 + 10/36 -
2/36, and that's 14/36.

183
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.150
That's P of sum equals seven
plus P of difference equals

184
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.485
one minus P of sum equals
7 and difference equals 1,

185
00:07:34.485 --> 00:07:38.710
so 14/36, which in
lowest terms is 7/18
