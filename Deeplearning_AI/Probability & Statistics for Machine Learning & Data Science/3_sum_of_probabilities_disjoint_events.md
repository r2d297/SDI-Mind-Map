00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.930
In this video, you're
going to learn about

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.045
the sum of probabilities,
which is quite simple.

3
00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:07.945
Consider the roll of a die.

4
00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:09.960
If you know the
probability of getting a

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.525
two and the probability
of getting a three,

6
00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:14.190
and you want to know the
probability of getting a

7
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.095
two or a three,

8
00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:18.895
then all you do is you
add these probabilities.

9
00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:20.355
However, there's a caveat.

10
00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:21.660
This doesn't work all the time.

11
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.940
We need to know if the
events are disjoint.

12
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.130
Let me explain. Let's go

13
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.170
back to the school but now
we have more information.

14
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.890
We have a school where kids
can only play one sport.

15
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.040
This is going to be
important. The sport

16
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.905
can be soccer or basketball.

17
00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.195
The probability that a
kid play soccer is 0.3.

18
00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:43.775
The probability that a
kid played basketball is

19
00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:46.515
0.4. Here's a question.

20
00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:48.110
What do you think is
the probability that

21
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.705
a kid play soccer or basketball?

22
00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:54.485
Remember at this school kids
can only play one sport,

23
00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:56.045
not two or more.

24
00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:58.550
If you want a hint,
imagine that there's

25
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.975
only 10 kids in the school

26
00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:02.425
and do the calculations
like that.

27
00:01:02.425 --> 00:01:05.480
Let's remember that the kids
can only play one sports.

28
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.725
Let's say there's 10 kids.

29
00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:09.465
If there's 10 kids then

30
00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:11.995
30% play soccer,
that's three of them,

31
00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:14.810
and 40% played basketball,

32
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.340
that's four of them,

33
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.260
and that makes 70% of the kids.

34
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.660
The probability that a kid
plays soccer or basketball

35
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.855
is the number of kids who
play soccer or basketball,

36
00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:29.225
divided by the total
number of kids.

37
00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:33.460
That is 3+4 /10 or 0.7.

38
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.810
Notice that we added
the probabilities.

39
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.020
The probability of
soccer was 0.3,

40
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.880
the probability of
basketball is 0.4,

41
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.160
and the probability of
soccer or basketball was

42
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.970
0.7, which is 0.3+0.4.

43
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.105
Now this can be seen in the
Venn diagram as follows.

44
00:01:50.105 --> 00:01:54.290
We're going to use the
letter U for union,

45
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.660
and if all the children are

46
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.660
here and 30 of them play soccer,

47
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.725
that's over here, and 40
of them play basketball,

48
00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:06.290
then the union is the ones that

49
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.215
play soccer or basketball so
is the ones I play soccer,

50
00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:11.285
and the ones that
played basketball,

51
00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:13.790
so is written like this, AUB.

52
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.340
The probability of
AUB is the sum of

53
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.515
the probabilities P(A) and P(B).

54
00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:21.530
Now let's see how the concept
of sum of probabilities

55
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.690
reflect in a die example,

56
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.730
let's say that you roll a
fair six-sided dice once.

57
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.220
What is the probability
of obtaining

58
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.925
an even number or a five?

59
00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:32.705
There are two events here.

60
00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:36.650
Event A is rolling
an even number.

61
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.930
That's three of them,

62
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.210
and event B is rolling a five
so that's one of them here.

63
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.160
Because the
probabilities get added,

64
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.480
then we have 3/6+1/6 and

65
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.475
so the probability
of even number

66
00:02:54.475 --> 00:02:57.840
or five is probability
of even number plus

67
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.765
the probability of
five, 3/6 +1/6.

68
00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:05.550
That is 4/6, which in
lowest terms is 2/3.

69
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.650
Now, here's another question.

70
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.460
If I roll two dice,

71
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.605
then what's the
probability of obtaining

72
00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:14.555
a sum of seven or a sum of 10?

73
00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:16.590
Well, let's consider two events.

74
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.735
The event A is that you
get a sum of seven,

75
00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:22.400
and the event B is that
you get a sum of 10.

76
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.880
Out of the 36 possibilities,

77
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.725
how many have a sum of seven?

78
00:03:26.725 --> 00:03:28.540
Well, there's the six over here.

79
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.700
Under the same 36 possibilities,

80
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.720
how many have a sum of 10?

81
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.950
There's this three over here,

82
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.525
6,4 5,5 and 4,6.

83
00:03:35.525 --> 00:03:37.990
When you look at the union,

84
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.840
so a sum of seven
or a sum of 10,

85
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.385
then we're looking at

86
00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:45.860
all these events that are
colored red or yellow.

87
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.695
Sum of seven, that is 6/36,

88
00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:55.465
and the sum of 10 is 3/36.

89
00:03:55.465 --> 00:03:59.620
When we add them,
we obtain 9/36,

90
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.040
which in lowest terms is 1/4.

91
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.875
This one over here
is the probability

92
00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:05.450
that the sum is seven,

93
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.085
this one over here is the
probability that the sum

94
00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:09.305
is 10 and we just added them.

95
00:04:09.305 --> 00:04:11.315
Now let's see yet
another example.

96
00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:13.130
What's the probability
of obtaining

97
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.860
a difference of two or
a difference of one?

98
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.710
Well again, we have
the two events.

99
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.600
A is the event that
difference is two,

100
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.900
and B is the event that
the difference is one.

101
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.930
Which pairs have a
difference of two?

102
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.055
These pairs over here.

103
00:04:26.055 --> 00:04:27.330
1, 3, 2,4, 3,

104
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.550
5 4, 6, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5,

105
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.135
3 and 6,4 because the difference
can be in any direction,

106
00:04:32.135 --> 00:04:33.650
can be the first
minus the second,

107
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.645
or the second minus the first.

108
00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:38.090
Similarly, for the
difference of one,

109
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.760
we have all these
pairs over here.

110
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.045
Now when we look at the union,

111
00:04:44.045 --> 00:04:45.620
they are over here,

112
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.645
it's this many so

113
00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:49.595
the probability of the
difference is two,

114
00:04:49.595 --> 00:04:53.530
or the difference is one is
equal to the sum of the two.

115
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.130
This one over here plus
this one over here.

116
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.960
The first one, there's
eight cases out of

117
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.700
36 so it's 8/36,

118
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.510
the second one is 10 cases
out of 36, so it's 10/36.

119
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.600
When you add them, we get 18/36.

120
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.880
That first one is

121
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.995
the probability that
the difference is two,

122
00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:14.940
the second one is that
the difference is one.

123
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.270
As you can see, 18 or 36 in

124
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.210
lowest terms is one-half
so it's actually 50%.
