1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.360
So let's apply this rule.

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.620
In a school with 100 kids,

3
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.780
again let's say 50 of them play
soccer and the other 50 don't play soccer.

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.599
Now we're going to split
them into two rooms of size 50.

5
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.500
And now they can go to any room they want.

6
00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.079
But here is more information.

7
00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:22.399
The first room has a TV
that is showing the World Cup.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.320
And the second room has a TV
that is showing a movie that is

9
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.320
completely unrelated to
soccer and each room fits 50 kids.

10
00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:35.990
Now out of your
intuition how many kids in room

11
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.520
one do you expect to like soccer and I'll

12
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.299
remind you the first room has a TV
playing the World Cup and the second one doesn't.

13
00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.560
So how many kids in room one
do you expect will like soccer?

14
00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.439
Well all things being fair we can
imagine that all the kids who like soccer

15
00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:55.539
went to the room with the TV that's
playing the World Cup as illustrated.

16
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.219
Maybe this didn't happen but we
can assume that that happened.

17
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.480
So these two events soccer
and room one are dependent.

18
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.079
Before they were independent,
but now they are dependent.

19
00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:10.620
In the example that we did
previously, the kids were split randomly.

20
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.560
That made the events independent.

21
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.120
But here, this is not the case. They're
dependent, so the probabilities change.

22
00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.319
Now let's do a slightly different
problem. Let's say we have a school of 100 kids.

23
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.280
40 of them play soccer and the rest don't.

24
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.489
And among the kids that play soccer,
we've noticed that on any given day,

25
00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.379
80% of them like to wear running shoes.

26
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.180
So now help me estimate how many kids
play soccer and wear running shoes.

27
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.500
So 40 kids are shown here and let's say
that 80% of them are wearing running shoes.

28
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.540
So let's split them into
groups of 20% each and four

29
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.420
of these sections are
wearing running shoes.

30
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.040
So that's 32 because 80% of 40 is 32.

31
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.900
And 32 is our estimate for how many kids
like soccer and are wearing running shoes.

32
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.239
So let's look at the same
problem from a different lens.

33
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.110
The probability that a kid plays soccer
is 40%. That means if we have 100 kids,

34
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.340
40 of them play soccer and
that's p of soccer equals 0.4.

35
00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.719
Now the probability of
not soccer is 0.6 or 60%.

36
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.259
That means that among these 100
kids, 60 of them don't like soccer.

37
00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:32.240
Now among the kids that play soccer,
80% of them are wearing running shoes.

38
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.379
Therefore, the probability of
running shoes given soccer is 0.8.

39
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.039
Now we want the probability of
soccer and running shoes well for that

40
00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.939
we need the probability of
soccer so that's this 40 over here

41
00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:55.979
times the probability of running
shoes given soccer which is this

42
00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:02.780
80 percent over here so 80
percent of 40 or 0.4 times 0.8,

43
00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:08.460
that's probability of soccer, times
probability of running shoes given soccer,

44
00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.740
and we get 0.4 times 0.8, and that's 0.32.

45
00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:21.020
That is the 32% that we expect that
will play soccer and wear running shoes.

46
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.199
So we say that the probability
of S intersection R is 0.32.

47
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.180
Now let's look at something else.

48
00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.060
Let's say that somebody tells
me the following information.

49
00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:37.240
The probability that a kid wears running
shoes when they don't like soccer is 50%.

50
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.520
That means that among the kids
that are not playing soccer,

51
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.979
half of them wear running shoes.

52
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.139
So what's the probability of
not soccer and running shoes?

53
00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.189
Well, P of not soccer
intersection running shoes,

54
00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.500
that means the kids who don't play
soccer and are wearing running shoes,

55
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.810
is equal to P of not soccer,
which is this 60% over here,

56
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.080
times P of running shoes given not soccer,

57
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.210
which is this 50% over here and so
that's 0.6 60% times 0.5 it's 50%

58
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.930
of 60% and that's 0.3 and that is
the probability that a kid does

59
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.240
not like soccer and is wearing
running shoes another way to see things

60
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.139
is with a tree of probability
so So two things can happen,

61
00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.819
the kid can play
soccer or not play soccer.

62
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.720
Plays soccer with a
probability of 40% and doesn't

63
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.399
play soccer with a probability of 60%.

64
00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:39.050
Now among the ones that play soccer wears
running shoes with a probability of 80%,

65
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.139
that's P, and doesn't wear running
shoes with a probability of 20%.

66
00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:45.779
And among the ones that
don't play soccer wear running

67
00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:47.709
shoes a priority of 20% and
among the ones that don't

68
00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:49.300
play soccer wear running
shoes a priority of 50%

69
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.879
and doesn't wear running
shoes a priority of 50%.

70
00:04:51.480 --> 00:05:01.319
So there's four scenarios when they play
soccer and wear running shoes play soccer and don't wear running shoes doesn't play soccer and wears running shoes doesn't play soccer

71
00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:06.069
and doesn't wear running shoes and the
probabilities are s intersection r 32 which

72
00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:11.490
is 80 of 40 or the product eight percent
for probability of s intersection r prime

73
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.259
that's not r that is the ones that play
soccer and don't wear running shoes that's 20

74
00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.990
of 40 or the product of 20 and 40 which is

75
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.699
eight percent for the ones that don't play

76
00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:29.470
soccer and wear running shoes that's 30%
because it's 50% of 60% or 0.6 and 0.5 and

77
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.560
the same thing for the ones that don't
play soccer and don't wear running shoes.

78
00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:37.920
So these are all the possibilities.

79
00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:43.160
So now let's recap the cases that we've
seen before since the very beginning.

80
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.240
First we split the kids
into two rooms randomly

81
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.579
and that created two independent events.

82
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.639
Independent events can be seen
graphically when the two lines,

83
00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.189
the one that splits the kids
from the room one and room

84
00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:00.740
two and the kids that play
soccer don't meet at a point.

85
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.279
So these events are independent.

86
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.689
Then we had the case when
they were running shoes or not

87
00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:09.110
wearing running shoes and
those events were dependent

88
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.139
because it's more likely that
the kid wears running shoes

89
00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.860
if they are playing
soccer than if they're not.

90
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.839
So those events are dependent.

91
00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:21.980
And another case was when we
sent them into two different rooms

92
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.389
but one of them had a soccer
game and the other one didn't,

93
00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.430
those cases were very dependent too,

94
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.480
because it's much more
likely that a kid will

95
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.540
go watch the soccer
game if they like soccer.

96
00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:38.579
Now, this may not be exactly
the same numbers we had before,

97
00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:41.779
but just to show you that
this case is also dependent.

98
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.689
And so when the lines cross, the
cases are independent like in the left,

99
00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:46.689
and when they don't cross the
cases are independent like in the left

100
00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:48.379
and when they don't cross
they're dependent like in the right.

101
00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:52.180
In the following ungraded lab
you'll have a chance to see some of

102
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.319
the ideas you've already
learned about probability in action.

103
00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:57.100
You'll use python to
simulate the birthday problem

104
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.569
I showed you earlier and
compare the results you

105
00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.040
get from those simulations
to the results you would

106
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.959
get if you solve these
problems analytically.

107
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.370
You will examine several different
variations of the birthday problem,

108
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.370
see visualizations of the
simulations used to address each problem,

109
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.680
and get walks through how to
analytically approach them as well.

110
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.649
I hope you enjoy
reinforcing what you've learned,

111
00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:17.860
and I'll see you when
you're done in the next video.
