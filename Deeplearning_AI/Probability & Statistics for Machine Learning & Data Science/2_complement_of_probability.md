00:00:02.338 --> 00:00:04.976
So in the last video you
learned about how to

2
00:00:04.976 --> 00:00:08.579
calculate the probability of
the occurrence of an event.

3
00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:13.029
So in this video we're going to talk
about the complement of an event and

4
00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.227
its probability.

5
00:00:14.227 --> 00:00:17.761
So this is the probability
that the event does not occur.

6
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:22.952
For example, if an event has
a probability of occurring of 75%,

7
00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:25.137
then the complement event or

8
00:00:25.137 --> 00:00:29.522
the probability that the event
does not occur is 25%.

9
00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:31.109
Let me elaborate.

10
00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.467
So let's go back to our school with ten
kids, where three of them play soccer and

11
00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:36.324
seven don't.

12
00:00:36.324 --> 00:00:37.544
Here's a question for you.

13
00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:42.501
What is the probability that a child does
not play soccer if they are picked at

14
00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:43.125
random?

15
00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:46.315
Well, to find the probability that
a child does not play soccer,

16
00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:49.801
that's denoted as P of not soccer,
then we do the same thing as before.

17
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:56.345
We count the number of kids who don't play
soccer and divide it by the total number,

18
00:00:56.345 --> 00:01:02.065
and that's going to be seven divided
by ten, that is the answer 0.7.

19
00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:07.028
However, you may have noticed that that
is related to the probability that

20
00:01:07.028 --> 00:01:11.912
the kid plays soccer, because
the probability of not soccer is 0.7 and

21
00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:15.804
the probability of soccer was 0.3,
and they add to 1.

22
00:01:15.804 --> 00:01:17.629
Turns out this always happens.

23
00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:24.494
And we can rewrite this as 1- 0.3 this
is essentially the complement rule.

24
00:01:24.494 --> 00:01:29.391
The complements rule states that
the probability of an event A not

25
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:34.121
occurring is equal to 1 minus
the probability of A occurring.

26
00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:39.052
So the probability of not soccer
is 1 minus the probability

27
00:01:39.052 --> 00:01:43.104
of soccer that's going to
be the complement rule.

28
00:01:43.104 --> 00:01:49.167
And we can formalize this rule as
follows P of A prime is 1- P of A,

29
00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:54.373
where A prime represents
the complement of the event A.

30
00:01:54.373 --> 00:01:58.247
That's when the event A does not happen.

31
00:01:58.247 --> 00:02:02.780
So, using this formula, we can calculate
the probability of an event not

32
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.643
happening in a more
straightforward manner.

33
00:02:05.643 --> 00:02:10.378
Now, as a Venn diagram, you can see
this in a similar way as before.

34
00:02:10.378 --> 00:02:13.150
Here you have the sample space.

35
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.459
Here you have the event of
playing soccer inside the circle.

36
00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.628
And the event of not playing soccer
is everywhere outside that circle,

37
00:02:21.628 --> 00:02:23.860
which is 70% if the circle is 30.

38
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.039
Now, using the experiment of flipping
three coins, here's a question for you.

39
00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.626
What's the probability of
not obtaining three heads?

40
00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:34.889
Well, by the complement rule, the
probability that none of the coins land in

41
00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.630
heads that's P of not three heads is equal
to 1 minus the probability of three heads.

42
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.993
And as you saw in a previous video,
this probability is 1/8.

43
00:02:42.993 --> 00:02:48.865
So we have 1 minus1/8,
and that is simply 7/8.

44
00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:54.557
You can also see it as the 7 good cases,
which are all minus the 3

45
00:02:54.557 --> 00:02:59.952
heads divided by the 8,
which is the total number of cases.

46
00:02:59.952 --> 00:03:02.497
Now let's apply the complement
rule to the dice experiment.

47
00:03:02.497 --> 00:03:03.805
If you throw one die,

48
00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:07.897
what is the probability of obtaining
anything different than 6?

49
00:03:07.897 --> 00:03:14.346
Well, we know there are 6 outcomes, and
the probability of not 6 is equal to 1,

50
00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:20.248
this 1 is 6 over 6, minus 1 over 6,
the probability of landing in a 6.

51
00:03:20.248 --> 00:03:27.049
So, The 6 is over here, here we remove
one of them, which is landing in a 6.

52
00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.420
And the answer is 5 over 6.
