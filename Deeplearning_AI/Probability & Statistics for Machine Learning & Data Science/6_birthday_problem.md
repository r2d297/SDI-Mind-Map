00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.160
Great work so far.
In this lesson,

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.240
we're going to talk about one of

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.560
the most fascinating problems in

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.760
probability, the
birthday problem.

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.980
Let's say you are with
three random people and

6
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.480
you're wondering
what's the probability

7
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.280
that two of you have
the same birthday?

8
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.100
It's probably very low.

9
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.800
Now, what if you were
with 200 random people?

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.480
You would say it's
very likely that

11
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.640
some two of them have
the same birthday.

12
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.920
What about 30 people?

13
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.015
What about 50 people?
One hundred people?

14
00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:29.100
Well, let me show
you what happens,

15
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.960
and the results may surprise
you. Here's the problem.

16
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.145
You have 30 friends at a party,

17
00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:37.770
among those 30 friends,
excluding yourself,

18
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.745
what do you think
is more likely,

19
00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:41.840
that there exists
two people who have

20
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.520
the same birthday or that

21
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.860
no two of them have
the same birthday?

22
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.220
Let's assume that this
year only has 365 days,

23
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.120
so there's not going to be
any February 29 birthdays,

24
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.740
just for the sake
of this problem.

25
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.400
The answer, believe it or not,

26
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.720
is that it's more likely that

27
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.700
two people have
the same birthday.

28
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.220
In fact, the probability
of no two people having

29
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.230
the same birthday
is only around 0.3.

30
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.960
Let me show you the math.

31
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.320
That's non-intuitive, because
if you think of 30 people,

32
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.640
it doesn't look that likely

33
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.960
that two of them have
the same birthday,

34
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.900
but there's a 70% probability

35
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.840
that two of them have
the same birthday.

36
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.920
Let's see why. Since
it's way easier,

37
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.700
we're going to focus
on the probability

38
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.980
that no two people have
the same birthday.

39
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.780
Remember that the probability
that at least two people

40
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.140
share the same birthday can be

41
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.165
obtained by taking
the complement.

42
00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:30.555
Here is the entire year.

43
00:01:30.555 --> 00:01:33.180
Let's imagine that
there's 365 boxes

44
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.260
here, even though there's less.

45
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.660
But let's pretend there are.

46
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.940
Let's look at the first one.

47
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.260
We're going to keep track of

48
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.640
the probability that among

49
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.260
the group that we're looking at,

50
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.420
everybody has a
different birthday.

51
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.140
If it's one person,
obviously they will not have

52
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.500
the same birthday as anyone else

53
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.320
because the group
only has one person.

54
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.035
The probability is 365/365.

55
00:01:55.035 --> 00:01:57.360
That's a one. Let me repeat
that last thing I said.

56
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.440
The probability is
365/365 which is one.

57
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.140
In other words, this
person can have a birthday

58
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.680
any day of the year and it's

59
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.440
not going to overlap
with anyone else.

60
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.700
Now let's add a second person.

61
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.040
What is the probability
that the two of

62
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.980
them have a different birthday?

63
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.020
What's the probability
that among these two,

64
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.560
there's no repeated birthdays?

65
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.360
Well, the other one has
to have pretty much

66
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.640
a birthday on any day

67
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.160
that's not the same
day of the first one.

68
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.020
We multiply by 364/365,so

69
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.220
it's still pretty high because

70
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.760
it's unlikely that if
you take two people,

71
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.060
they will have the
same birthday.

72
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.080
Now let's add one more person.

73
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.080
We want that person not to have

74
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.480
a birthday at the same time
as any of the other two.

75
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.320
They can have a
birthday in any of

76
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.850
the remaining 363
days out of 365.

77
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.560
The probability that these

78
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.600
three have all
different birthdays,

79
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.985
now it's (365*364*363/365)^3,

80
00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:01.005
because every time
we have a new event,

81
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:03.155
then we multiply by
this probability.

82
00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:05.400
If we add a fourth person, well,

83
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.340
now they can have a birthday
in any of the days that are

84
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.755
not taken, that's 362/365.

85
00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:13.380
If we add a new person,

86
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.020
they again can
have a birthday in

87
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.100
any of the days
that are not taken,

88
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.540
we multiply by 361/365,

89
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.720
and if we add one more person,

90
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.980
then we multiply by
360/365, and one more,

91
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.380
we multiply by 359,

92
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.680
and so on and so forth.

93
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.200
If we have this group
of nine people,

94
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.840
then what is the
probability that

95
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.860
they all have birthdays
on different days?

96
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.950
It's the product of
all these numbers,

97
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.635
and that's actually 0.905.

98
00:03:42.635 --> 00:03:44.860
In other words, if I have
a group of nine people,

99
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.540
the probability that there's

100
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.185
no overlapping birthdays
is roughly 90%.

101
00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:51.860
It's very high, because
among nine people,

102
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.980
most likely there are
no repeated birthdays.

103
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.360
But now let's actually do

104
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.680
the plot for this probability
with more people.

105
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.460
As we saw, among a
group of one person,

106
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.685
the probability has no
repeated birthdays, is one.

107
00:04:05.685 --> 00:04:10.965
For two people, remember
that it was 364/365,

108
00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:14.805
that's 0.997, and we
kept multiplying this by

109
00:04:14.805 --> 00:04:19.165
other factors like 363/365 etc.

110
00:04:19.165 --> 00:04:21.060
When we keep track
of this product,

111
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.920
then as you can see, the
number starts decreasing.

112
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.005
For 20 people, it's
already 0.589.

113
00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:30.230
For 23 people, it's 0.493.

114
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.040
So, for 23 people,

115
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.780
it's already more likely to have

116
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.705
a birthday in common than
no birthdays in common.

117
00:04:36.705 --> 00:04:39.285
For 30 people, it's 0.294.

118
00:04:39.285 --> 00:04:42.060
For 50 people,
it's already 0.03.

119
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.650
Among 50 people, it's

120
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.360
very likely that two of them
have the same birthday.

121
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.790
For 100 people is
already very small.

122
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.080
For 366 people,

123
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.110
already it's zero, because by

124
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.650
then you have to
have one repetition.

125
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.630
The plot is on the right,

126
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.410
where in the horizontal axis

127
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.550
we have the number of people,

128
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.270
and in the vertical
axis the probability.

129
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.765
Notice how quickly
it drops and it

130
00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:08.970
stops being bigger
than 0.5 around here,

131
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.670
which is exactly at 23 people.

132
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.350
If you are ever in a
party with 23 people,

133
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.430
you can bet that there's

134
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.970
a repeated birthday and

135
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.480
you would win more
than half of the time.

136
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.455
As you see, this was
quite non-intuitive.

137
00:05:25.455 --> 00:05:26.980
However, we calculated

138
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.590
the probabilities and
that's what we got.
